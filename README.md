# Python-Face-Swapper
 A conceptual script to swap faces between two images using OpenCV
# Python Face Swapper (Conceptual)

This project contains a simple Python script for a conceptual face-swapping task. It uses the **`OpenCV`** library for image manipulation. **This is a basic demonstration and assumes the faces are in a known, similar location in both images.** A more advanced implementation would require a dedicated face detection model.

## Features
- Demonstrates basic image manipulation and region of interest (ROI) handling with `OpenCV`.
- Swaps predefined rectangular regions from two images.

## Requirements
- Two images with faces in similar positions and sizes.
- `opencv-python` and `numpy` libraries.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your two images in the project directory and name them `image1.jpg` and `image2.jpg`.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal:
